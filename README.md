# sourcemod-nt-water-nades
Experimental SourceMod plugin for Neotokyo. Make players on land take damage from nearby submerged explosives.

## Background
In NT, players on land take no damage from submerged explosives.
Fully submerged players also don't take damage from explosions on land.
This plugin makes players on land still take damage by nearby underwater explosions.
